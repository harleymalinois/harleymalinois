- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @harleymalinois
- ðŸ“« This is my BIO ...

Creating something is so much fun and this got me into programming. I'm a web developer focused on front-end.

I'm curious and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new. I design and build websites. 
I do my best and work closely with clients to articulate their vision in a design. 
I use Adobe XD to create mockup, and then I develop a custom WordPress theme to match 
the design and desired functionality. I'm fluent in HTML and CSS and pretty handy with PHP and JavaScript.

As of now, my focus is to help small business get started on the internet by designing and building websites 
that are professional and clean, with a content-management system so the client have a total control of their 
brand narratives. We will work together as a team throughout all the phases of website design and development 
process in order to bring the vision for your website forward and into reality.

As we begin the process of building your site, I'll learn about you, your business, and your customers. 
I'll combine this information with my experience in coding and design so that together we can develop a 
plan to help your business grow. Aside from web development, I also have experience in multimedia editing 
such as photo editing and video editing. I use Adobe Photoshop as image editor and Filmora as a video editor.

I studied Information Technology major in Programming at Southern Leyte State University at Southern Leyte, 
Philippines. My first professional web experience was after I graduated where I was referred as a web developer.

Aside from mentioned above, I like to go to beaches on my free time and enjoy freediving and spearfishing. 
I also play Ultimate Frisbee as my sport and play online games. When I'm at home, I do gardening.
